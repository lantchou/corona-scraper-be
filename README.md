# Corona Scraper (Belgium Edition)

Very simple Python Web scraper I wrote because I manually checked the Worldometer website on a daily basis to inform myself of how many new COVID-19 cases/deaths there are in Belgium. Of course I want to be both paranoid __and__ lazy, so manually checking the website wasn't going to cut it anymore. It simply gathers & prints out todays total amount of new COVID-19 cases and deaths in Belgium.
